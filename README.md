# 🍷 Optimizing Conjoint Analysis with Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains the code, results, and thesis report for my MSc thesis at the University of Groningen.
A study of wine preference through Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis using MNL, Hierarchical Bayesian approach, and Machine Learning method.

---

## 📄 Abstract

This study investigates how traditional and machine learning methods perform in analyzing **Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC)** data. We compare models on **predictive accuracy**, **interpretability**, and **managerial decision-usefulness**, using a wine preference dataset as a case study.
